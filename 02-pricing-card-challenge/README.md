This challenge is an HTML + CSS challenge (with a small amount of JavaScript for practice) from Frontend mentor.  
[Here is the challenge starter link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc).

The `Pricing Card Challenge/` folder has four solution files in it:

1. `index.html`
2. `script.js` 
3. `style.css`
4. `styleFlexbox.css`

There are two CSS files. `styleFlexbox.css` is similar to `style.css`, but it employs a simpler approach by utilizing the Flexbox layout method.

[Here is the Codepen solution using Flexbox](https://codepen.io/Sara-Ebrahimkhani/pen/PoXGwKm).
